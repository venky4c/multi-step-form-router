**Key Learnings**

- Implementing React Context using TS was a challenge due to the additional Types and Interfaces to be declared upfront
- useState, useEffect, and useCallback hooks were used
- useHistory hook from React Router is used to navigate between tabs
- Tabs are conditionally disabled if the user is not yet permitted to reach a tab
